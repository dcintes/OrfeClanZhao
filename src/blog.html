        <p class="fs-4">The Orphan of Zhao is a Chinese play from the Yuan era, attributed to the 13th-century
          dramatist
          Ji Junxiang (紀君祥). The play has as its full name The Great Revenge of the Orphan of Zhao. The play is
          classified in the zaju genre of dramas. It revolves around the central theme of revenge.</p>

        <p>The play is divided in six parts, comprising five acts (折 zhe) and a wedge (楔子 xiezi), which may be an
          interlude
          or—as it is in this case—a prologue. It contains both dialogue and songs. The story of The Orphan of Zhao
          takes place during the Spring and Autumn period. The protagonists are General Han Jue in the first act, the
          retired Minister Gongsun Chujiu (公孙杵臼) in the second and third act, and the Zhao orphan in the final two
          acts.
          The Orphan of Zhao was the earliest Chinese play to be known in Europe.</p>

              <p>Duke Ling was the ruler of the Jin state. In his court, Minister Zhao Dun and General Tu'an Gu were two
                of
                his
                most influential subordinates. However, Tu'an Gu had a deep hatred for Zhao Dun. He wanted to destroy
                his rival, Zhao Dun, and exterminate the Zhao family. General Tu'an Gu succeeded in framing Zhao
                Dun, and slaughtered 300 members of the Zhao family. Soon thereafter, a decree was forged in the
                duke's name to order the death of General Zhao Shuo, the son of Zhao Dun. Zhao Shuo had namely been
                spared
                during the massacre as he was married to Lady Zhuang, the daughter of Duke Ling. When General Zhao Shuo
                received the forged decree, he commits suicide.</p>

              <p>Zhao Shuo and his wife were expecting a child, but the infant was born after the tragic circumstances
                involving
                his
                father's death. Tu'an Gu, intending to get rid of the newborn infant, orders General Han Jue to surround
                the
                palace. Lady Zhuang entrusts her newborn child to the physician Cheng Ying, a retainer to the Zhao
                family. However, she knew—as Cheng Ying had indicated—that she would be pressured to reveal where her
                child
                is,
                thus she took her own life. As the physician Cheng Ying was entrusted to keep the child safe, he
                attempts
                to
                escape with the child hidden in his medicine chest. While Cheng is departing through the palace gates,
                he
                is
                stopped and questioned by Han Jue. Eventually, Han Jue discovered the child, whom Cheng Ying had tried
                to
                hide
                and keep safe. However, troubled by his sense of compassion, he allows Cheng Ying and the infant to
                escape. Thereafter he commits suicide by taking his sword to his throat, realizing that he will be
                tortured
                for what happened to the orphan.</p>

                life.
                The Zhao orphan, now known as Cheng Bo, has reached maturity. General Tu'an Gu has no child of his own,
                thus
                he had adopted the Zhao orphan, unknowingly of his true identity, and named him Tu Cheng. On a fateful
                day,
                the
                orphan is in Cheng Ying's study, where he discovers a scroll depicting all the people involved in the
                tragic
                events
                relating to his early life. Cheng Ying decides the time has come to show the tragedy of the Zhao family
                and
                reveal to the orphan the truth of his origins. Various tragic events featuring many loyal friends and
                retainers, who gave their lives, were depicted on the scroll.</p>

          <p class="col col-md-4 fs-4">Until Ji Junxiang's play in the 13th century, the story appeared in prose form as
            historical narrative. After
            Ji's
            play, stage drama was the main form, with numerous regional operas, some completely independent of his play.
          </p>

          <p class="col col-md-8">The Records of the Grand Historian, written by the historian Sima Qian from the Han
            dynasty, contains a
            chapter
            surrounding the events of the Zhao family. These records were adapted by Ji Junxiang in The Orphan of Zhao.
            The play depicts the theme of familial revenge, which is placed in the context of Confucian morality and
            social
            hierarchical structure. Although there might have been an intended emphasis on social values and norms, Shi
            (2009) stated that the many violent scenes all the more serve the purpose of theatrical entertainment, while
            also inciting the emotional and moral feelings of the audience. Shi (2009) remarked that Cheng Ying's
            suffering
            and endurance, as he was forced to live in his enemy's household so he could protect the orphan, could be
            interpreted as an ironic reflection by the author about the ethno-political circumstances of the Yuan era.
            The
            author therefore tried to incorporate Han institutions of Confucian values through his work.</p>

        The Orphan of Zhao was the first Chinese play to be translated into any European language. The Jesuit father
        Joseph Henri Marie de Prémare translated the play, which he titled L'Orphelin de la Maison de Tchao, into French
        in 1731. In Premaré's work, the dialogue was translated, but not the songs. The story caught the
        imagination of European minds at a time when chinoiserie was in vogue and this translation was the basis for
        adaptations over the next few decades.
